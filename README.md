# Hugo PaperMod Template

## How to use this template

1. Click the "Use this template" button above.
2. Change the `baseURL` in `config.yml` to your site's URL. e.g. `https://<your_github_id>.github.io/<your_repo_name>`
3. Create a markdown file to write your content in `content` folder.
4. Commit and push your changes to your repo.
5. Bingo! Your site is live at `https://<your_github_id>.github.io/<your_repo_name>`

Notice: If you meet the problem like `remote: Permission to xxx denied to github-actions[bot].` when you push your changes, you need to give the permission to the `github-actions[bot]` in your repo's `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions -> Read and write permissions -> Save`.
